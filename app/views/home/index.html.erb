  		<p>After extensive research on current dependency check tools, we discovered that there are few existing tools that allow users to manage the security status of a large number of repositories. This tool needs to target a breadth of programming languages, many different project owners, and across different teams of developers. To address this issue, we designed a web application that runs a pipeline of static analysis tools on projects to uncover security vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>Our application focuses on streamlining security managersâ€™ workflow of managing multiple repositories. Users can authorize through Github with just a couple of simple clicks and can initiate the security scanning process on any number of target projects. This is followed by straightforward reports detailing vulnerabilities discovered, with a feature to provide instant feedback to the project owner. The importance of this feedback is to connect security-focused users and general software developers to establish efficient feedback loop.</p>
